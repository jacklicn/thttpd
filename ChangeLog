New in version 2.26:

• Some more throttling changes that smooth things out a lot. 
• Added an experimental limitation on the number of simultaneous CGIs. 
• Chown the log file when starting as root, so that it can later be re-opened when running as nobody (or whatever user you configure). Also tweak the logfile pathname so that it still works inside a chroot tree. 
• Make sure URL paths begin with a slash. 
• Generate multiple MIME encodings in the correct order, and with the correct separator.

• Keep a list of free connection structs, instead of doing linear search to find a free one (Adam Zell).
